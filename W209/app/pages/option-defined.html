            <h4>Gist</h4>
            <p>An <em>options contract</em> is a special kind of contract in which one party sells another party the right - but not the obligation - to either buy or sell some other asset at a pre-determined price. An options contract is also a kind of investment security. Just like for common stock or exchange-traded funds, they can be bought and sold at securities exchanges.</p>
            <p>Every options contract is defined by four basic characteristics:
                <dl>
                    <dt>Underlying</dt>
                    <dd>The asset an option permits you to buy or sell is called the <em>underlying asset</em>. The underlying can be any other kind of security or commodity: Stocks, bonds, commodities, futures contracts, etc.</dd>
                    <dt>Kind</dt>
                    <dd>An option's <em>kind</em> determines whether it allows you to buy or sell the underlying. <em>Call</em> options let you buy the product, and <em>put</em> options give you the right to sell it.</dd>
                    <dt>Strike price</dt>
                    <dd>The price for which the option allows you to buy or sell the underlying asset is called the <em>strike price</em>.
                    <dt>Expiration date</dt>
                    <dd>Options don't last forever. Every options contract has a pre-determined <em>expiration date</em>. They are typically scheduled at regular intervals. For example, most weekly options expire on Fridays, and monthly options normally expire on the third Friday of the month.</dd>
                </dl>
            </p>
            <p>The price of the contract matters too, of course. In options trading, this is also referred to as the option's' <em>premium</em>. We'll cover what factors influence an option's price in a later section.</p>

            <h4>Exercising Options</h4>
            <p>When you decide to use your option to buy or sell the asset, that is called <em>exercising</em> the option. What happens next depends on the kind of option. If it's a call option, you give them the specified amount of money, and they give you the asset. If it's a put option, you give them the asset, and they give you the specified amount of money. The option you exercised is also voided, so you cannot use it again.</p> 
            <p>If, instead, you were the seller of the options contract, then everything happens in reverse. You have no control over whether the option gets executed, the buyer of the option gets to decide that. If they do execute it, then we say that you were <em>assigned</em> the option. When you get assigned, what happens is also the opposite: For call options you give them the asset and they give you the money, and for put options you give them the money and they give you the asset.</p>
