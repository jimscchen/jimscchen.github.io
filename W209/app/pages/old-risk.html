                    <dt>Consider the case below where you buy Apple stock at $140 a share, and the price jumps to $160 a share.
                        However, you have good intel that the price will tank to $100 a share soon. There is a "risk" that
                        you'll lose money when the price drops. You can offset this risk by buying puts at the $160 strike
                        for $5, so that for every dollar you lose on stock, you gain a dollar from the options.
                    </dt>
                    <br>
                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <button class="button" id="CoverPut">Click here to hedge by buying puts</button>
                            <div id="coveredPut" class="plot">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <dt>Say you have an option position that's appreciated $100,000 since you bought it. The position is protected
                        against price changes, but sensitive to increases in volatility (i.e. short lots of vega). If you
                        know volatility will skyrocket, and this would mean big losses, as we've simulated below. </dt>
                    <br>
                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <button class="button" id="addStraddle">Click here to increase volatility</button>
                        <div id="straddle" class="plot"></div>
                    </div>

                    <dt>However, all options increase in value when volatility increases, so we can protect against this volatility
                        risk by paying $5 for calls and puts near the current stock price -- this is where the volatility
                        sensitivity is greatest for options.</dt>
                    <br>
                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <button class="button" id="increaseVol">Click here to buy puts and then increase volatility</button>
                        <div id="straddleGain" class="plot"></div>
                    </div>
                    <dt>It's important to consider that options have different sensitivities to volatility and price change at
                        every strike. This means that even if your position is balanced when stock is trading at one price,
                        it will change when the price moves considerably.<br><br> Below is the amount of total volatility
                        sensitivity we have at each strike when the stock is trading at $105.  Sensitivity to volatility is greatest for strikes near the stock price, meaning that our risk may flip if the stock starts trading around strikes where we're short options, such as below.
