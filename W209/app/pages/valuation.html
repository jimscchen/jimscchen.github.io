            <h4>The big picture</h4>
            <p>So how do you know what's a fair price for an option? That's a big topic - books have been written on the subject - but, in a nutshell, an option's price is influenced by several factors: 
                <dl>
                    <dt>Underlying asset price</dt>
                    <dd>Since your potential for profit depends on the difference between the strike price and the underlying's price, any change in the underlying asset's price will change how much the option is worth.</dd>
                    <dt>Strike price</dt>
                    <dd>The strike price doesn't change the way the underlying asset's does, but it still plays into the options' value for the reason mentioned above.</dd>
                    <dt>Volatility</dt>
                    <dd>All other things being equal, the more the underlying's price jumps around, the more likely the option is to bounce into the money.</dd>
                    <dt>Time</dt>
                    <dd>Similarly, the more time the underlying's price has to jump around, the more likely the option is to become profitable.</dd>
                </dl>
            </p>
            <p>Traders quantify all of the above factors using a set of variables collectively known as the <em>Greeks</em>. Each one is a coefficient that describes how an option's value will change with respect to some other variable such as time or price. The next few slides will go over them in turn.</p>
