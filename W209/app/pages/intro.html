            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Imagine you're the owner of XYZ Coach Lines, a regional bus service. One of your most significant operating costs is diesel fuel. The buses won't run without it, so you need to buy it every month. Suppose you are worried that the price of fuel is going to go up in the coming months. That would be very costly to your business, so you want to come up with a way to protect yourself against that risk. How might you do that?</p>
            <p>One thing you could do is to stockpile fuel. You could buy all the fuel you can afford right now. If the price of fuel does go up, then you save money because you bought fuel at the present (low) price. That's not necessarily an ideal solution, though. For one, you would have to install extra tanks to store all that fuel, and that would be expensive. It would also take time - by the time the new storage facilities are constructed, the price might already have gone up. Worse, what happens if the price of fuel goes down instead? Then you didn't save any money on the fuel - in fact, you spent more - and you're als out all the money you spent on having those tanks installed.</p>
            <p>So instead of that, what if you entered into a special contract with your fuel supplier. You pay them a small fee now, and in return they agree to let you buy fuel a few months from now, at a pre-arranged price. Even if the price goes up, you can get your fuel at the pre-determined rate, so now you don't have to worry so much about the price going up, and you also don't have to build your own personal fuel storage facility. Better yet, this contract doesn't lock you in. If the current price of fuel goes up, you still only have to pay the price you agreed on. If the price gos down, that's fine, too. You can simply choose not to exercise the contract, and go buy your fuel at the market rate instead.</p>

            <h2>Options</h2>
            <p>This kind of contract is called an <em>option</em> because the agreement is optional: You get to decide whether to hold the other person to it or not.</p>
