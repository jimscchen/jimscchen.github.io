The <a href="./chris-goals.jpg">first JPG</a>
lists the some questions the subsequent
visualizations want to address
They are:
<ul>
  <li>which instruments contribute most to portfolio risk?
  <li>which instruments collectively influence risk;
      ie, which instruments balance each other
  <li>given a risky set of intstruments,
      what might it cost to balance their risk
</ul>

<p>
The first visualization is meant to show
the overall risk profile of examined profile
at some moment in time.  The slider on the
right is an "Apple Time Machine" selector.
You use it to pick your portfolio/position
as of the chosen date, a la "terms."

<p>
The size of the option/stock is getting
smaller as the time extends into the future.
</p>

The angle on the dial corresponds to risk
relative to the portfolio as of the time
picked in slider.  90&deg; and green
means that instrument is offsetting
a lot of risk.  -90&deg; and red
means that instrument is very risky.

Keep in mind, the risk is relative to
the portfolio as it exists at the chosen time.
</p>

<p>
The second visualization shows what happens
when you click on an instrument.
That instrument gets highlighted,
and so do instruments that relate
to the one clicked on.  So, if you
click on an option for AAPL that
was high in risky delta, you might
see AAPL stocks in your portfolio
that would offset that risk
highlighted along with that option.
